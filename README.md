# exploring_python
This is repository is meant to be a collection of code snippets about intricacies of python. Anyone who is a python enthusiast is welcome to contribute here. I've adopted the following three sources:

  * Book - Pro Python by Marty Alchin
  * Official python lanugage reference - https://docs.python.org/2/reference/index.html
  * Misc articles on stack overflow which I come across
